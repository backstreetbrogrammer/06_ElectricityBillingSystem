# Project 6 - Electricity Billing System

## Project Overview

### Problem
Current electricity billing system to deliver paper bills receipt to each customer and receive payments is all manual.
It is very time-consuming and laborious process because staff needs to visit the customer's house every month to give the bills and receive payments or impose any fine due to delayed payments.
